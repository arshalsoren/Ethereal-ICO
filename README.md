# Ethereal-ICO
- Smart Contract for [Ethereal].(https://github.com/arshalsoren/Ethereal)
- Buy and Sell Ethereal.

## Requirements
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
- [MyEtherWallet](https://github.com/arshalsoren/Ethereal-ICO/tree/main/etherwallet-v3.11.2.4)
- I used [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for Solidity.

## How does it work?
- Deploying the smart contract [ethereal_ico](https://github.com/arshalsoren/Ethereal-ICO/blob/main/ethereal_ico.sol) on MyEtherWallet, on a custom node(offline) created using Ganache.

- You can see a new block is mined and transaction is added into it.
